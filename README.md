# termdvd
A program that simulates the DVD video screensaver in the terminal.

Now even people without a display server can enjoy the thrill of watching the DVD icon hit the corner. Amazing!

# General info
This program was programmed in Python 3, so make sure before running it that you have Python 3.x installed. (Python 2.x
won't work)

This program should work on any OS that has Python 3 ported to it. This includes Windows, macOS, Linux, and BSD.

This program has no installer, nor does it need one, because it's literally just one py file. All you have to do after downloading the program is
run it.


# NOTICE
The developer (That's me!) is stupid, and doesn't know how to do argument parsing in Python. This means, for now, the
program will prompt you to enter some required parameters when run.
Argument parsing is down the pipeline, but for now, the program doesn't have any.
